# ECE631
This repo contains the lab work done for the ECE 6310 Intro to CV course taught by Adam Hoover at Clemson University.

In the Lab 1, students were asked to implement three different versions of 7x7 filter : 1) Standard 7x7 mean filter 2) Separable 7x7 filter 3) A combination of Separable and Sliding Filter. The C scripts conv2d, sepfilter, sep_slidingfilter are for standard 7x7 filter, separable filter and hybrid of separable and sliding window filter. Since each of the scripts were to be timed, Each script will append the text file with name - "timekeeping_<filter name>.txt".
